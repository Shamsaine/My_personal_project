# My_personal_project
This is my first personal project repository to test run a lot of things I've learnt.
This project repository is the first I am building on my own with no guide at all. It will contain a bunch of trial and errors mistakes (I am sure you have seen some already right from this readme). 

This repo contain different sections seperated into folders to represent my different fields of interest from Data analysis to Data science to Software engineering to web development and lots more.
